## v0.4.0

**If you are setting PyApp variables, this is a breaking change!**

- Move environmental variables to their own table in `pyproject.toml`. They are now in `[tool.box.env-vars]`.
- Remove PyApp Variables from initialization and put them into their own command.
- Add a new command `box env` in order to manage environmental variables.
  - Add `box env --set KEY=VALUE` to add string variables.
  - Add `box env --set-int KEY=VALUE` to add integer variables.
  - Add `box env --set-bool KEY=VALUE` to add boolean variables.
  - Add `box env --get VAR_NAME` to get the value of a variable.

If this breaks your project, you can either run `box uninit` followed by `box init` and re-enter the variables, or you can manually edit the `pyproject.toml` file.

## v0.3.0
